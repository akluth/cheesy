### What is cheesy?
cheesy is a simple terminal emulator designed for simplicity - and mainly for my own
workflow and purpose to be honest.

### Build
Simply clone the repo. After that, enter the three most iconic commands you know when
using Linux:

    ./configure
    make
    (sudo) make install

You need gtk-3 and vta-2.91 installed (with their corresponding development files).

After that just call `cheesy`.

### Usage
There's not that much so see and to do: You can increase or decrease the transparency
(if supported by your window manager) with `CTRL-+` and `CTRL--` and change the colortheme
to a slightly different one with `F1`. You can select text and copy it to the clipboard via
`CTRL-SHIFT-C` and paste text from the clipboard to the terminal with `CTRL-SHIFT-V`.

That's it.

Although there's some more functionality to come, cheesy will remain a simple and small
terminal emulator.

#### 'cheesy' has not the most positive meaning in the english language, so why calling a terminal emulator so?
For me 'cheesy' has a different meaning. And it's my secret :-)
